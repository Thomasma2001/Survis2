abstract = {Three-dimensional reconstruction based on optical satellite images has always been a research hotspot in the field of photogrammetry. In particular, the 3D reconstruction of building areas has provided great help for urban planning, change detection and emergency response. The results of 3D reconstruction of satellite images are greatly affected by the input images, and this paper proposes an improvement method for 3D reconstruction of satellite images based on the generative adversarial network (GAN) image enhancement. In this method, the perceptual loss function is used to optimize the network, so that it can output high-definition satellite images for 3D reconstruction, so as to improve the completeness and accuracy of the reconstructed 3D model. We use the public benchmark dataset of satellite images to test the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. The experiments show that compared with the satellite stereo pipeline (S2P) method and the bundle adjustment (BA) method, the proposed method can automatically reconstruct high-quality 3D point clouds.},

Due to multiple political and physical barriers, accessing desertification-prone areas is complex, complicating pathways towards generating a hands-on understanding of the time–depth and distribution of archaeology throughout these regions. This research developed a remote sensing methodology to determine the areas of Sistan experiencing the highest levels of desertification and the threat of that desertification to known and potential archaeology. As desertification processes are occurring rapidly, this work’s methodology is straightforward and efficient. In a region of vast archaeological value, desertification threatens to prevent archaeologists from potential insight and discovery. This work showcases the opportunity for remote sensing to work as a tool for accessing archaeology in physically inaccessible desertification-prone regions.},

abstract = {Digital Surface Model (DSM) generation from high-resolution optical satellite images is an important topic of research in the remote sensing field. In optical satellite imaging systems, the attitude information of the cameras recorded by satellite sensors is often biased, which leads to errors in the Rational Polynomial Camera (RPC) model of satellite imaging. These errors in the RPC model can mislead the DSM generation. To solve the above problems, we propose an automatic DSM generation method from satellite images based on the Double-Penalty bundle adjustment (DPBA) optimization algorithm. In the proposed method, two penalty functions representing the camera’s attitude and the spatial 3D points, respectively, are added to the reprojection error model of the traditional bundle adjustment optimization algorithm. Instead of acting on images directly, the penalty functions are used to adjust the reprojection error model and improve the RPC parameters. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method using high-resolution satellite image pairs and multi-date satellite images. Through some experiments, we compare the accuracy and completeness of the DSM generated by the proposed method, the Satellite Stereo Pipeline (S2P) method, and the traditional bundle adjustment (BA) method. Compared to the S2P method, the experiment results of the satellite image pair indicate that the proposed method can significantly improve the accuracy and the completeness of the generated DSM by about 1–5 m and 20%–60% in most cases. Compared to the traditional BA method, the proposed method improves the accuracy and completeness of the generated DSM by about 0.01–0.05 m and 1%–3% in most cases. The experiment results can be a testament to the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) combining machine learning with differentiable rendering have arisen as one of the most promising approaches for novel view synthesis and depth estimates. However, NeRFs only applies to close-range static imagery and it takes several hours to train the model. The satellites are hundreds of kilometers from the earth. Satellite multi-view images are usually captured over several years, and the scene of images is dynamic in the wild. Therefore, multi-view satellite photogrammetry is far beyond the capabilities of NeRFs. In this paper, we present a new method for multi-view satellite photogrammetry of Earth observation called remote sensing neural radiance fields (RS-NeRFs). It aims to generate novel view images and accurate elevation predictions quickly. For each scene, we train an RS-NeRF using high-resolution optical images without labels or geometric priors and apply image reconstruction losses for self-supervised learning. Multi-date images exhibit significant changes in appearance, mainly due to cars and varying shadows, which brings challenges to satellite photogrammetry. Robustness to these changes is achieved by the input of solar ray direction and the vehicle removal method. NeRFs make it intolerable by requiring a very long time to train an easy scene. In order to significantly reduce the training time of RS-NeRFs, we build a tiny network with HashEncoder and adopted a new sampling technique with our custom CUDA kernels. Compared with previous work, our method performs better on novel view synthesis and elevation estimates, taking several minutes.},

abstract = {Abstract. Tie-point matching of off-track stereo images is a very challenging task, which can impact bias compensation and digital surface model (DSM) generation. Compared to in-track stereo images, off-track stereo images are more complex primarily due to the radiometric differences caused by sun illumination, sensor responses, atmospheric conditions, and seasonal land cover variations, and secondly due to the longer baseline and larger intersection angle. These challenges significantly limit the use of the vast number of images in satellite archives for automated geometric processing and mapping. Recent advances in deep learning (DL) based matching show promising results against images with diverse illuminations, viewing angles and scales through learning examples. This paper evaluates the potentials of addressing the tie point matching problems in off-track satellite stereo images. Specifically, we focus on stereo pairs that failed or underperformed in classic matching algorithms (i.e., SIFT (scale invariant feature transform)), and evaluate the DL-based tie points matchers by its resulting geometric accuracy in relative orientation, and the generated DSM. The experiments are carried out using 40 off-track satellite stereo pairs from four different regions around the world. We conclude that DL-based methods provide a significant higher success rate in matching challenging multi-temporal stereo pairs, even if their matching accuracy is slightly lower than classic algorithms.

abstract = {A large amount of information needs to be identified and produced during the process of promoting projects of interest. Thermal infrared (TIR) images are extensively used because they can provide information that cannot be extracted from visible images. In particular, TIR oblique images facilitate the acquisition of information of a building’s facade that is challenging to obtain from a nadir image. When a TIR oblique image and the 3D information acquired from conventional visible nadir imagery are combined, a great synergy for identifying surface information can be created. However, it is an onerous task to match common points in the images. In this study, a robust matching method of image pairs combined with different wavelengths and geometries (i.e., visible nadir-looking vs. TIR oblique, and visible oblique vs. TIR nadir-looking) is proposed. Three main processes of phase congruency, histogram matching, and Image Matching by Affine Simulation (IMAS) were adjusted to accommodate the radiometric and geometric differences of matched image pairs. The method was applied to Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images of building and non-building areas. The results were compared with frequently used matching techniques, such as scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), speeded-up robust features (SURF), synthetic aperture radar–SIFT (SAR–SIFT), and Affine SIFT (ASIFT). The method outperforms other matching methods in root mean square error (RMSE) and matching performance (matched and not matched). The proposed method is believed to be a reliable solution for pinpointing surface information through image matching with different geometries obtained via TIR and visible sensors.},

abstract = {In this study, we present a large-scale earth surface reconstruction pipeline for linear-array charge-coupled device (CCD) satellite imagery. While mainstream satellite image-based reconstruction approaches perform exceptionally well, the rational functional model (RFM) is subject to several limitations. For example, the RFM has no rigorous physical interpretation and differs significantly from the pinhole imaging model; hence, it cannot be directly applied to learning-based 3D reconstruction networks and to more novel reconstruction pipelines in computer vision. Hence, in this study, we introduce a method in which the RFM is equivalent to the pinhole camera model (PCM), meaning that the internal and external parameters of the pinhole camera are used instead of the rational polynomial coefficient parameters. We then derive an error formula for this equivalent pinhole model for the first time, demonstrating the influence of the image size on the accuracy of the reconstruction. In addition, we propose a polynomial image refinement model that minimizes equivalent errors via the least squares method. The experiments were conducted using four image datasets: WHU-TLC, DFC2019, ISPRS-ZY3, and GF7. The results demonstrated that the reconstruction accuracy was proportional to the image size. Our polynomial image refinement model significantly enhanced the accuracy and completeness of the reconstruction, and achieved more significant improvements for larger-scale images.},

abstract = {The study of ancient irrigation is crucial in the archaeological research of arid regions. It covers a wide range of topics, with the Near East being the focus for decades. However, political instability and limited data have posed challenges to these studies. The primary objective is to establish a standardised method applicable to different arid environments using the Google Earth Engine platform, considering local relief of terrain and seasonal differences in vegetation. This study integrates multispectral data from LANDSAT 5, Sentinel-2, SAR imagery from Sentinel 1, and TanDEM-X (12 m and 30 m) DSMs. Using these datasets, calculations of selected vegetation indices such as the SMTVI and NDVSI, spectral decomposition methods such as TCT and PCA, and topography-based methods such as the MSRM contribute to a comprehensive understanding of landscape irrigation. This paper investigates the influence of modern environmental conditions on the visibility of features like levees and palaeo-channels by testing different methods and parameters. This study aims to identify the most effective approach for each case study and explore the possibility of applying a consistent method across all areas. Optimal results are achieved by combining several methods, adjusting seasonal parameters, and conducting a comparative analysis of visible features.},

In contrast to previous variants of NeRF proposed in the literature for satellite images, EO-NeRF outperforms the altitude accuracy of advanced pipelines for 3D reconstruction from multiple satellite images, including classic and learned stereovision methods. This is largely due to a rendering of building shadows that is strictly consistent with the scene geometry and independent from other transient phenomena. In addition to that, a number of strategies are also proposed with the aim to exploit raw satellite images. We add model parameters to circumvent usual pre-processing steps, such as the relative radiometric normalization of the input images and the bundle adjustment for refining the camera models. We evaluate our method on different areas of interest using sets of 10-20 pre-processed and raw pansharpened WorldView-3 images.},

The post-storm ground reference data consisted of field and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) observations of windthrow combined with no-damage areas collected by visual interpretation of the available very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery. We trained and tested a thresholding model using canopy height change as the sole predictor. We undertook a two-step accuracy assessment by (1) running k-fold cross-validation on the ground reference dataset and examining the effect of the potential imperfections in the ground reference data, and (2) conducting rigorous accuracy assessment of the classified map of the study area using an extended set of VHR imagery. The thresholding model produced accurate windthrow maps in dense, productive forest stands with a sensitivity of 96%, specificity of 71%, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) over 0.7. However, in sparse and high elevation stands, the classification accuracy was poor. Despite certain collection challenges during the winter months in the Nordic region, we consider VHR stereo satellite imagery to be a viable source of forest canopy height information and sufficiently accurate to map windthrow disturbance in forest stands of high to moderate density.},

The method proposed in this paper works on satellite images obtained with SASPlanet. It uses two color spaces (RGB and HSL) and filters (Canny, Sobel, and Laplacian) jointly with supervised machine learning to improve the detection of archaeological structures in areas with a lot of vegetation. The method obtains an average performance of at least 93% on precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy.

abstract = {The Easternmost Mediterranean is a transition region from the ocean to the continent where the spreading and collision zones of the lithospheric plates join. The methodology of paleomagnetic mapping of the transition zones is based on combining geological and geophysical techniques for continental and oceanic platforms: magnetic data interpretation, paleomagnetic reconstructions, results of magnetized rock radiometric dating, satellite data analysis, tectonic–structural reconstructions, biogeographical studies, and utilization of different geophysical survey results. The satellite-derived gravity map reflects practically all significant tectonic units in the region, which assists us in the supposed paleomagnetic mapping. The satellite-derived and aeromagnetic maps with the tectonic features and the map of Curie discontinuity of Israel indicate the complexity of this region. Advanced magnetic data analysis supported by paleomagnetic data attraction and other geological–geophysical methods allowed the revealing of the block of oceanic crust with the Kiama paleomagnetic zone relating to the Early Permian age. A narrow reversely magnetized Earth crust block was revealed in the Lower Galilee. Some examples of advanced magnetic anomaly analysis are presented for several areas where the magnetization vector inclination is other than the modern direction: the Sea of Galilee, Carmel, Rosh-Ha-Ayin, Malqishon, and Hebron. In Israeli land, for the combined paleomagnetic mapping, the well-studied using paleomagnetic and radiometric methods (as well as tectonic–structural) areas were selected: (1) Makhtesh Ramon, (2) the Sea of Galilee with the adjoining zones, (3) Carmel, (4) Hula, and (5) Hermon. It is shown that the regional analysis of paleomagnetic data distribution played an essential role in detecting the influence of the recently recognized counterclockwise rotating mantle structure on the near-surface layers.},

abstract = {Cameras are the prevalent sensors used for perception in autonomous robotic systems, but their initial calibration may degrade over time due to dynamic factors. This may lead to a failure of downstream tasks, such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) or object recognition. Hence, a computationally lightweight process that detects the decalibration is of interest. We describe a modification of StOCaMo, an online calibration monitoring procedure for a stereoscopic system. The method uses robust kernel correlation based on epipolar constraints; it validates extrinsic calibration parameters on a single frame with no temporal tracking. In this paper, we present a modified StOCaMo with an improved recall rate on small decalibrations through a confirmation technique based on resampled variance. With fixed parameters learned on a realistic synthetic dataset from CARLA, StOCaMo and its proposed modification were tested on multiple sequences from two real-world datasets: KITTI and EuRoC MAV. The modification improved the recall of StOCaMo by 25 % (to 91 % and 82 %, respectively), and the accuracy by 12 % (to 94.7 % and 87.5 %, respectively), while labeling at most one-third of the input data as uninformative. The upgraded method achieved the rank correlation between StOCaMo V-index and downstream SLAM error of 0.78 (Spearman).},

abstract = {Archaeologists have likely collected, as a conservative estimate, billions of artifacts over the course of the history of fieldwork. We have classified chronologies and typologies of these, based on various formal and physical characteristics or ethno-historically known analogues, to give structure to our interpretations of the people that used them. The simple truth, nonetheless, is that we do not actually know how they were used or their intended purpose. We only make inferences—i.e., educated guesses based on the available evidence as we understand it—regarding their functions in the past and the historical behaviors they reflect. Since those inferences are so fundamental to the interpretations of archaeological materials, and the archaeological project as a whole, the way we understand materiality can significantly bias the stories we construct of the past. Recent work demonstrated seemingly contradictory evidence between attributed purpose or function versus confirmed use, however, which suggested that a basic premise of those inferences did not empirically hold to be true. In each case, the apparent contradiction was resolved by reassessing what use, purpose, and function truly mean and whether certain long-established functional categories of artifacts were in fact classifying by function. The resulting triangulation, presented here, narrows the scope on such implicit biases by addressing both empirical and conceptual aspects of artifacts. In anchoring each aspect of evaluation to an empirical body of data, we back ourselves away from our assumptions and interpretations so as to let the artifacts speak for themselves.},

State-of-the-art reconstruction methods typically produce 2.5D elevation data. In contrast, we propose a one-stage method directly generating a 3D mesh model from multi-view satellite imagery. We introduce a novel Sat-Mesh approach for satellite implicit surface reconstruction: We represent the scene as a continuous signed distance function (SDF) and leverage a volume rendering framework to learn the SDF values. To address the challenges posed by lighting variations and inconsistent appearances in satellite imagery, we incorporate a latent vector in the network architecture to encode image appearances. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-view stereo constraint to enhance surface quality. This constraint minimizes the similarity between image patches to optimize the position and orientation of the SDF surface. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual quality and quantitative accuracy in generating mesh models. Moreover, our approach can learn seasonal variations in satellite imagery, resulting in texture mesh models with different and consistent seasonal appearances.},

abstract = {Abstract. Stellar is a large, satellite stereo dataset. It contains rectified stereo pairs of the terrain captured by the satellite image sensors and corresponding true disparity maps and semantic segmentation. Unlike stereo vision in autonomous driving and mobile imaging, a satellite stereo pair is not captured simultaneously. Thus, the same object in a satellite stereo pair is more likely to have a varied visual appearance. Stellar provides flexible access to such stereo pairs to train methods to be robust to such appearance variation. We use publicly available data sources, and invented several techniques to perform data registration, rectification, and semantic segmentation on the data to build Stellar. In our preliminary experiment, we fine-tuned two deep-learning stereo methods on Stellar. The result demonstrates that most of the time, these methods generate denser and more accurate disparity maps for satellite stereo by fine-tuning on Stellar, compared to without fine-tuning on satellite stereo datasets, or fine-tuning on previous, smaller satellite stereo datasets.

abstract = {A lunar rover’s optical camera is used to provide navigation and terrain information in an exploration zone. However, due to the scant presence of atmosphere, the Moon has homogeneous terrain with dark soil. Also, in extreme environments, the rover has limited data storage with low computation capability. Thus, for successful exploration, it is required to examine feature detection and matching methods which are robust to lunar terrain and environmental characteristics. In this research, SIFT, SURF, BRISK, ORB, and AKAZE are comparatively analyzed with lunar terrain images from a lunar rover. Experimental results show that SIFT and AKAZE are most robust for lunar terrain characteristics. AKAZE detects less quantity of feature points than SIFT, but feature points are detected and matched with high precision and the least computational cost. AKAZE is adequate for fast and accurate navigation information. Although SIFT has the highest computational cost, the largest quantity of feature points are stably detected and matched. The rover periodically sends terrain images to Earth. Thus, SIFT is suitable for global 3D terrain map construction in that a large amount of terrain images can be processed on Earth. Study results are expected to provide a guideline to utilize feature detection and matching methods for future lunar exploration rovers.},

abstract = {Real-time kinematic (RTK) positioning of the global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) is used to provide centimeter-level positioning accuracy. There are several ways to implement RTK but a Kalman filter-based RTK is preferred because of its superior capability to resolve GNSS carrier phase integer ambiguities. However, the positioning performance of the Kalman filter-based RTK is often compromised by various factors when it comes to determining a precise relative position vector between moving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with low-cost GNSS receivers and antennas, where the locations of both GNSS antennas are not accurately known and change over time. Some of the critical factors that lead to a high rate of incorrect resolutions of carrier phase integer ambiguities are measurement time differences between GNSS receivers, frequent cycle slips with high noise in code and carrier phase measurements, and an improper Kalman filter gain due to a newly risen satellite. In this paper, effective methods to deal with those factors to achieve a seamless Kalman filter-based RTK performance in moving UAVs are presented. Using our extensive 45 flight tests data sets, conducted over a duration of 3 to 12 min, the RTK positioning results showed that the root-mean-square position error (RMSE) decreased by up to 95.13%, with an average of 65.31%, and that the percentage of epochs that passed the ratio test, which is the most common method for validating double differenced carrier phase integer ambiguity resolution, increased by up to 130%, with an average of 23.54%.},

The proposed method renders new views and infers surface models of similar quality to those obtained with traditional state-of-the-art stereo pipelines. Multi-date images exhibit significant changes in appearance, mainly due to varying shadows and transient objects (cars, vegetation). Robustness to these challenges is achieved by a shadow-aware irradiance model and uncertainty weighting to deal with transient phenomena that cannot be explained by the position of the sun. We evaluate Sat-NeRF using WorldView-3 images from different locations and stress the advantages of applying a bundle adjustment to the satellite camera models prior to training. This boosts the network performance and can optionally be used to extract additional cues for depth supervision.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional reconstruction utilizing few-view satellite images can effectively reduce the cost of resources. However, methods that rely on dense stereo matching suffer severe performance degradation when confronted with differences of intersection angles and illumination in such non-standard stereo images, which are limited by the matching mechanism. Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) get rid of the matching restriction by utilizing the rendering pipeline, which has made significant progress in the synthesizing novel views and 3-D reconstruction. Nevertheless, when the available images are few-view and multidate, insufficient geometric constraints and illumination variations present great challenges in generating accurate 3-D models. In this article, we proposed a 3-D reconstruction framework called few-view multidate (FVMD)-implicit surface representation (ISRe), which is based on the ISRe of NeRF, for generating complete watertight mesh and digital surface model (DSM) from FVMD satellite images. We introduce the positional encoding with adaptive frequency module to extract finer geometric information from few-view images. Then, the solar information is incorporated into the rendering process, allowing the network to distinguish color changes arising from illumination differences in multidate images. Additionally, we employ some tricks like coordinate system optimization and network restructuring for enhancing network training. Advantages of FVMD-ISRe are demonstrated through both qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted on the US3D dataset. The results highlight our framework’s capacity to reconstruct accurate 3-D geometry, overcome the performance of traditional methods based on stereo matching and other NeRFs in various evaluation metrics.

The main objective was to test an archaeological hypothesis regarding the existence of an Iron Age summit compound which was supported by monumental stone retaining walls. We used a wheeled GPR with simultaneous central frequencies of 200, 400, and 800 MHz. Despite attenuation in the topsoil, scattering by distributed rock fragments, and asphalt pavement, we were able to penetrate almost a meter and detect anomalies. Some of the GPR anomalies are consistent with the above-mentioned theory, meaning that their locations agree with data retrieved in nearby control trenches and with the plan of the site. The excavation findings, jointly with the GPR interpretation, indeed imply the existence of a rectangular monumental summit compound that dates to the 8th century BCE.},

The results of our preparatory remote sensing research and subsequent fieldwork in Jordan and Israel between 22 February and 23 March 2023, within the framework of the research project entitled “Travel and Mobility in Hellenistic and Early Roman Palestine”, are reported and discussed. Part of this project is a large-scale, systematic research attempt to discover additional ancient pre-Roman roads and to suggest a working methodology for future research. The methodology is supposed to combine remote sensing research and archaeological survey. The project’s first fieldwork achieved several goals. First, the modern methods enabled us to provide a high-resolution capture of the detected features and artifacts, including the courses of ancient roads and the locations of road-related archaeological sites. Altogether, 105 road remains, 62 archaeological sites, and 14 pottery findings were identified; what is more, 11 GPS (Global Positioning System) tracks of ancient roads were registered. Second, we suggested necessary revisions to the previous state of research and reported new findings. For instance, newly discovered rock art evidence found along Glueck’s Road confirms the continuity of the use of this road long into late antiquity and early Islam. Third, some methodological conclusions were reached. For example, a multi-source approach to identifying ancient roads including the use of archival cartographic sources, archival and modern satellite and aerial imagery, and the databases of archaeological sites is still necessary. However, there can be no doubt that spatial analyses and remote sensing studies must be accompanied by archaeological fieldwork, which is absolutely necessary for determining the dating of the roads (by dating the settlement and pottery) and a detailed identification of the road courses (particularly through the discovery of road-related infrastructure).},

abstract = {Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables the acquisition of high-resolution imagery even under severe meteorological and illumination conditions. Its utility is evident across a spectrum of applications, particularly in automatic target recognition (ATR). Since SAR samples are often scarce in practical ATR applications, there is an urgent need to develop sample-efficient augmentation techniques to augment the SAR images. However, most of the existing generative approaches require an excessive amount of training samples for effective modeling of the SAR imaging characteristics. Additionally, they show limitations in augmenting the interesting target samples while maintaining image recognizability. In this study, we introduce an innovative single-sample image generation approach tailored to SAR data augmentation. To closely approximate the target distribution across both the spatial layout and local texture, a multi-level Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture is constructed. It comprises three distinct GANs that independently model the structural, semantic, and texture patterns. Furthermore, we introduce multiple constraints including prior-regularized noise sampling and perceptual loss optimization to enhance the fidelity and stability of the generation process. Comparative evaluations against the state-of-the-art generative methods demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in terms of generation diversity, recognizability, and stability. In particular, its advantages over the baseline method are up to 0.2 and 0.22 in the SIFID and SSIM, respectively. It also exhibits stronger robustness in the generation of images across varying spatial sizes.},

abstract = {In the past, manual inspection was often used for equipment inspection in indoor environments such as substation rooms and chemical plant rooms. This way often accompanies high labor intensity, low inspection efficiency, and low safety, which is difficult to meet the increasingly stringent requirements of indoor equipment operation and maintenance management. For dealing with these issues, a VIORB-SLAM2 algo-rithm based on the integration of IMU and visual information, was proposed by this paper. Firstly, the IMU data and image data were integrated to restore scale information of cameras, and then an error function was established to enhance the algorithm’s robustness. Secondly, in order to improve the accuracy of the algorithm, the random sampling consensus method was used to eliminate the wrong matching points in feature point matching, and the normalized cross-correlation matching was employed to constrain key frame matching conditions. Finally, through the iterative closest point method to stitch the point clouds, a dense map for navigation was constructed. The experimental results show that the algorithm designed by this paper has solved the shortcomings of applying the ORB-SLAM2 algorithm to indoor inspection robots while achieving high positioning accuracy, which can be combined with other algorithms in the field of artificial intelligence for object detection and semantic map construction in the future.},

This study has two primary objectives: (1) develop an efficient predictive modeling for the generation of future FAF images and prediction of future Stargardt atrophic (as well as GA) regions and (2) develop an efficient predictive modeling with advanced 3D OCT features at ellipsoid zone (EZ) for the comparative performance in the generation of future enface EZ maps and prediction of future Stargardt atrophic regions on OCT as on FAF. To achieve these goals, we propose two deep neural networks (termed ReConNet and ReConNet-Ensemble) with recurrent learning units (long short-term memory, LSTM) integrating with a convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder–decoder architecture and concurrent learning units integrated by ensemble/multiple recurrent learning channels. The ReConNet, which incorporates LSTM connections with CNN, is developed for the first goal on longitudinal FAF. The ReConNet-Ensemble, which incorporates multiple recurrent learning channels based on enhanced EZ enface maps to capture higher-order inherent OCT EZ features, is developed for the second goal on longitudinal OCT. Using FAF images at months 0, 6, and 12 to predict atrophy at month 18, the ReConNet achieved mean (±standard deviation, SD) and median Dice coefficients of 0.895 (±0.086) and 0.922 for Stargardt atrophy and 0.864 (±0.113) and 0.893 for GA. Using SD-OCT images at months 0 and 6 to predict atrophy at month 12, the ReConNet-Ensemble achieved mean and median Dice coefficients of 0.882 (±0.101) and 0.906 for Stargardt atrophy. The prediction performance on OCT images is comparably good to that on FAF. These results underscore the potential of SD-OCT for efficient and practical assessment of atrophy progression in clinical trials and retina clinics, complementing or surpassing the widely used FAF imaging technique.},
